## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **2 more non-Latin locales**, bringing the total to **36 shipped
  languages** with **11 distinct non-Latin scripts**:
    * `ta` Tamil   (~75M speakers)
    * `te` Telugu  (~95M speakers)
  Both render correctly out of the box on Windows (Nirmala UI covers
  all 10 Indic scripts), macOS, and Linux distros with the Noto
  family installed.  Screenshots added to the README gallery.
- **Package-manager manifests** in `packaging/` for the three free
  Windows / macOS / Linux managers:
    * **WinGet** — `Struis112.SmtpTestTool` (`winget install ...`)
    * **Scoop**  — bucket at `Struis112/scoop-bucket`
    * **Homebrew** — tap at `Struis112/homebrew-tap`
  Each manifest is auto-refreshed on every release: a new
  `refresh-manifests` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs
  after `release` + `publish`, pulls the SHA-256 sidecars from the
  GitHub Release, rewrites the YAML / JSON / Ruby files, and commits
  them back to `main` with a `[skip ci]` marker.  Mirroring the
  manifests to the upstream registries is documented in
  `packaging/README.md` and remains a manual one-liner per release
  (cross-repo PATs were ruled out to keep the trust surface small).
- README `## Install` section grows three new top entries that point
  at the package managers; the prebuilt-binary fallback stays for
  users who prefer a direct download.

### Notes
- Tamil and Telugu translations are machine-generated, like every
  non-`en` / `nl` locale.  PRs from native speakers welcome - the
  contribution flow is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **5 more non-Latin locales**, bringing the total to **34 shipped
  languages** with **9 distinct non-Latin scripts**:
    * `hi` Hindi (Devanagari) - ~600M speakers
    * `bn` Bengali - ~270M speakers
    * `fa` Persian / Farsi (Arabic script with extensions) - ~110M
    * `th` Thai - ~70M speakers
    * `he` Hebrew - ~9M speakers
  Each is machine-translated with a `locale.status_note` in its own
  language flagging it as such and welcoming native review.  All five
  render correctly on the bundled GUI thanks to `src/fonts.rs`
  discovering `Nirmala UI` (Indic), `Leelawadee UI` (Thai), and
  `Segoe UI` (Hebrew + Persian) automatically on Windows; macOS and
  Linux candidate lists already include their equivalents.
- **Localised screenshot gallery in the README** (zh, ja, ko, ar, fa,
  he, hi, bn, th) - visual proof that the OS-font-discovery story
  actually works end-to-end.

### Fixed
- **`tools/screenshot.ps1` root cause finally found.**  Both
  `PrintWindow(PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT)` and a *rect-restricted*
  `CopyFromScreen` return blank surfaces for the eframe glow GL
  window under Windows 11 DWM in certain DPI / monitor configs.  The
  working approach is to snapshot the entire virtual screen and crop
  to the window rect in software - DWM composites the GL surface into
  the desktop bitmap and a full-screen `CopyFromScreen` reads it back
  fine.  Script now does this on the fallback path automatically.
- New `-Locale` parameter on `tools/screenshot.ps1` so future
  contributors can regenerate any locale's screenshot with one
  command.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **CJK + Arabic locale rendering** via OS font discovery.  New
  `src/fonts.rs` consults `fontdb 0.23` (an `std`/`memmap`/`fontconfig`
  build of the same library `resvg` uses) for system-installed font
  families that cover the active locale's script - `Microsoft YaHei`,
  `Yu Gothic UI`, `Malgun Gothic`, `Segoe UI Arabic`, `Noto Sans CJK *`,
  `Source Han Sans *`, etc.  Discovered fonts are appended to egui's
  Proportional **and** Monospace fallback chains, so Latin glyphs in
  mixed strings still render with egui's bundled `Inter`/`Hack` and
  only fall through to the system font for codepoints `Inter` cannot
  draw.  Latin/Cyrillic/Greek locales bypass the discovery entirely
  and pay zero startup cost.
- **4 new locales**: `zh` (Simplified Chinese), `ja` (Japanese), `ko`
  (Korean), `ar` (Arabic) - bringing the total to **29 shipped
  languages**.  All four are machine-translated with a
  `locale.status_note` flag in their own language welcoming native
  review.  Arabic is rendered with egui 0.34's existing bidi support;
  layout polish is best-effort until a future eframe gains a full
  ICU-driven LTR/RTL engine.
- `tools/README.md` now documents the **interactive-desktop-session
  requirement** for `tools/screenshot.ps1` and adds a post-capture
  size sanity check, since `PrintWindow` returns empty surfaces under
  service / WinRM / headless SSH contexts on Windows.

### Changed
- `Cargo.toml` adds `fontdb 0.23` as an optional dependency tied to
  the `gui` feature.  CLI-only builds (`cargo build --no-default-features
  --features keychain`) are unaffected.

### Notes
- Native review remains welcome for every machine-translated locale.
  PRs touching one locale file at a time are easiest to merge.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **Internationalisation framework** (`src/i18n.rs`) with TOML-backed
  translation tables, compile-time embedded, no extra dep beyond the
  existing `toml` and the new tiny `sys-locale 0.3`.  Public API:
  `t(key)`, `t_with(key, args)`, `set_locale(code)`,
  `current_locale()`, `available_locales()`, `is_supported(code)`,
  `native_name(code)`.  Missing keys fall back to base 'en'; unknown
  locales silently use base.
- **OS locale auto-detection** (`src/locale.rs`) via `sys-locale`,
  normalised to a 2- or 3-letter code (`nl_NL.UTF-8` -> `nl`).
- **Localised diagnostic hints**: every string from `smtp_hints_for`,
  `imap_hints_for`, `pop_hints_for`, and the client-bounce table now
  flows through `t()`.  Switching locale switches the language of
  every hint and its 'Action:' / 'Hint:' prefix.
- **Fully localised GUI**: every label, button, tab name, tooltip,
  status chip, and Diagnose-tab string.  New **Language picker** on
  the Advanced tab that always shows OS-locale + English only — at
  most two options regardless of how many locales ship.
- **Localised CLI prompts** plus a new `--locale CODE` flag.
- **`Profile.locale`** (TOML field) for explicit per-profile
  language override; `None` = auto-detect each launch.
- **25 shipped languages**: `en` (base, hand-maintained), `nl`
  (native quality), plus 23 machine-translated languages covering
  the full Latin / Cyrillic / Greek script range: `bg`, `cs`, `da`,
  `de`, `el`, `es`, `fi`, `fr`, `hr`, `hu`, `id`, `it`, `no`, `pl`,
  `pt`, `ro`, `ru`, `sk`, `sr`, `sv`, `tr`, `uk`, `vi`.  Each
  machine-translated file's `locale.status_note` flags review
  status in that file's own language.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** gains a `## Translations` section with two
  recipes: how to native-review a machine-translated file, and how
  to add a brand-new language.

### Known issues
- **CJK / Indic / Arabic / Thai not yet shipped.**  eframe's bundled
  fonts cover Latin + Cyrillic + Greek; shipping Chinese / Japanese /
  Korean / Hindi / Bengali / Tamil / Telugu / Arabic / Persian / Urdu /
  Thai requires either bundling Noto fonts (≈30-40 MB binary growth)
  or implementing OS-font discovery (via `font-kit` or hand-rolled).
  Tracked as a future-work item.
- The `docs/screenshots/gui-{dark,light}.png` files in this release
  show the GUI at v0.1.1: the Provider-preset menu + full-width
  credentials fields are visible, but the new keychain Save/Forget
  buttons and the *Diagnose bounce* tab are not.  Regeneration via
  `tools/screenshot.ps1` produced empty captures during the v0.1.2
  session for reasons not yet root-caused (egui GL surface + Windows
  `PrintWindow` interaction).  Tracked as a follow-up.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **OS-native keychain integration** behind a new `keychain` cargo
  feature (on by default).  Windows Credential Manager / macOS
  Keychain / Linux Secret Service via `keyring 3.6`.
  * `src/keystore.rs` exposes a `Keystore` trait with `save`, `load`,
    `forget`; `OsKeystore` (real) and `NullKeystore` (graceful no-op
    for builds without the feature).  6 unit tests use an in-memory
    `MockKeystore` so the suite passes on every OS, including headless
    Linux CI runners.
  * CLI: `--keychain-load` looks up the password at startup;
    `--keychain-save` writes it after a successful run only
    (failed AUTH never leaks a wrong password); `keychain status
    <user>` / `keychain forget <user>` subcommands inspect and manage
    entries.
  * GUI: *Save password to keychain* / *Forget keychain entry* buttons
    under the credentials block.  Auto-loads on startup when an entry
    exists for the current user, showing a small *(loaded from
    keychain)* hint next to the controls.
- **CLI provider parity** with the GUI: `--provider gmail` and
  friends (case-insensitive, unique-substring resolver), plus a
  `providers` subcommand that prints the full curated list.
- **Gmail 'Send mail as' client-side bounce diagnostic**: a user who
  pastes the bounce body (English or Dutch verbatim) into
  `smtp_hints_for` now gets an actionable pointer to *Gmail Settings
  > Accounts and Import > Send mail as > Edit info*.

### Changed
- `AGENTS.md` rule #8 expanded: OS keychain is now the documented
  one-and-only approved persistent store for credentials.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-19

### Security
- **Removed all persistence of credentials.**  `Profile::password` and
  `Profile::oauth_token` are now `#[serde(skip)]`; the base64 "opt-in"
  codepath, the GUI checkbox, and the `base64` crate dependency are
  all gone.  Enforced by `tests/config_roundtrip.rs::
  save_never_writes_credentials_even_when_set`.  Codified as rule #8
  in `AGENTS.md`.  **BREAKING**: a v0.1.0 user who had a saved
  `password_b64` in their config will need to re-enter the password
  on next launch.

### Changed
- **`send_test` now defaults to TRUE** (was false in v0.1.0).  Hitting
  *Run Test* on a fresh install will exercise the full end-to-end path
  including delivery, Send-As rights, and spam filters - not just AUTH.
  Users who want auth-only behaviour can untick the *Actually send a
  test email* box on the Send Mail tab.  Existing v0.1.0 configs that
  explicitly set `send_test = false` keep that value; configs missing
  the field will now load as true (matches fresh-install behaviour).

### Added
- **Provider-preset menu** (`src/providers.rs`) with eleven curated
  presets: Outlook.com, Microsoft 365, Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, Proton
  Mail (Bridge), Fastmail, Zoho, AOL, GMX, Yandex.  Picking one from
  the top-bar *Provider preset ▾* menu rewrites the SMTP/IMAP/POP3
  host, port, and security fields on the active profile and logs an
  app-password / Bridge note where one applies.  Replaces the old
  one-shot "Reset to Outlook.com" button.
- **Manual theme override on the GUI Advanced tab.**  Auto / Dark /
  Light, with the resolved OS hint shown next to the Auto label;
  persisted through `Profile.theme` so existing v0.1.0 configs keep
  working without a migration.
- Dark + light GUI screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`, regenerable
  on Windows via `tools/screenshot.ps1`.  Linked from the README.
- 14 additional tests (now 17 total, was 3): full diagnostic
  translator coverage (SMTP enhanced-code boundaries, IMAP
  AUTHENTICATIONFAILED / LOGINDISABLED, POP -ERR phrases) plus a new
  integration test suite at `tests/config_roundtrip.rs` covering
  save+load symmetry, opt-in password obfuscation, multi-profile,
  and defaults-fallback for minimal hand-written configs.

### Fixed
- **Default config filename was still `email_tester.toml`** after the
  project rename, so `discover_config_path()` never found the file
  every doc told the user to create.  The GUI showed 'no config
  file' even with a valid TOML next to the exe; the CLI silently
  fell back to built-in Outlook defaults.
- GUI Servers tab body rendered empty due to a nested-ScrollArea
  height race in the egui 0.34 layout.  Split the log into its own
  resizable BottomPanel; tabs now get a properly-sized CentralPanel.
- GUI log panel was drowning in eframe / winit / glow / wgpu DEBUG
  noise.  Default tracing filter is now `info,eframe=warn,...`;
  power users can opt into more verbose output via `RUST_LOG`.
- `Config::load` parse errors are no longer silently swallowed; the
  GUI now logs the path and error so users can tell 'no config' from
  'config exists but won't parse'.

### Changed
- `cargo deny` `multiple-versions` ratcheted from `warn` to `deny`.
  The 20 known duplicate transitives are enumerated in `deny.toml`
  with a `reason` field each; any NEW duplicate will fail CI.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Initial Rust port of the email connectivity tester.
- CLI binary (`smtp-test-tool`) with TOML config + named profiles and
  Outlook.com defaults.
- GUI binary (`smtp-test-tool-gui`) built on eframe/egui with OS
  dark/light auto-follow (hand-rolled detection, no third-party crate)
  and AccessKit screen-reader support.
- IT-actionable diagnostic translator for the most common Microsoft
  365 SMTP failure codes (5.7.60 SendAsDenied, 5.7.139 Basic-Auth-
  disabled, 5.7.57 unauthenticated MAIL FROM, …).
- Hand-rolled IMAP + POP3 clients over `rustls` so we own the full
  wire trace.
- Public release infrastructure: GitHub Actions CI matrix (fmt,
  clippy, test on Linux/macOS/Windows, MSRV 1.92, cargo-deny,
  cargo-llvm-cov → Codecov, cargo doc → GitHub Pages); release
  workflow producing cross-OS binaries on tag push and publishing
  to crates.io.

### Project conventions
- `AGENTS.md` captures the working agreement: WCAG 2.2 AAA is the
  baseline, dark+light mode on every OS is mandatory, atomic
  conventional commits, no shortcuts.
